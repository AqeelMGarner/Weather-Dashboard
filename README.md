# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

My motivation for building this application is to help the user find the weather forecast in their city. The reason why i built this application was for the user to see the weather forecast in their  city and for next five days. The problem my application solves is the user can easily find the weather report from their location. What i learned in the making this application was how to effectively use API's and bring the content to my webpage.
